        <p><span class="aboutmep">About Me: </span><br> My name is Bhakti Nagaria. I am born in U.S.A in Maryland at Howard Country General Hospital. I am a girl with too many hobbies. In my family there are two people which is me and my Mom, 
        but I did't mention about my father right ? Let me tell you guys that my father has passed away in 2006 so, since that time is just me and my Mom living together. I am a android fanatic. I like to search trending things. 
        I never stop exploring new things. I love to be on social media , who doesn't right ? I am mostly active on youtube, tiktok and Instagram. 
        These is a lot in my life that I wanna learn & achieve. i want to learn with my ability to have great interest in many subsects i hope to gain a lot of knowledge in many areas and also become a respected photographer and a photo editor. 
        Honestly is a top proirity for me. So that's the reason I became a Web developer, reading my bio lets you know that i love technology.
