I never stop Goggling things. I admire Barack Obama. I like Samsung and Android. I’m a social media enthusiast. I am mostly active on youtube & twitter. There is a lot in my life that I want to achieve and learn. I am caring, hard working & loving person and also a geeky person too. With my ability to have great interest in many subjects I hope to gain a lot of knowledge in many areas. I am currently Coding my very own website.

         	<p>My love of photography started with my purple Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (AKA) My Favorite Color. So now i've captured great photos now they have to be edited. This is something I enjoy doing since it allows me to practice even more ways to be creative. You can also expect me to share this with you as of course we all wanna make the world as a better place and as a living organism. Its my duty to pass on my knowledge. I am currently coding my very own site, and trying to learn more about programming which will be my future job for the time being.</p>
